# Calculator-API
Python API

This is a proof of concept for my calculator API.

To boot up the server execute run.py
All server settings are also found in run.py, im currently using port 8080, but depending on your router you might want to change that.

You will need the following libraries to run the software:
Python 3.6
Flask
Flask_restful
Gevent

Endpoints:
/Calculator/
